Here is Cantor&amp;rsquo;s original proof (in German, but the math is universal, so somewhat understandable even without knowing German):
Georg Cantor, Ueber eine elementare Frage der Mannigfaltigkeitslehre. Published in Jahresbericht der Deutschen Mathematiker-Vereinigung, Volume 1, 1891.
Its only a bit over 2 pages long, and its easy to see Cantor&amp;rsquo;s answer to the ``Is 0 a Natural Number?</description>

Update (7 Sept): There is a correction on slide 10 to the way we defined addition for the Set-based Natural Numbers (thanks to Nijat Khanbabayev for pointing out the problem).
Some of the material from today&amp;rsquo;s class (and what we will continue on Monday) is in the TCS Book, Chapter 2.</description>

      <description>PDF for Printing Honor Expectations As a student at the University of Virginia, you are trusted to be honorable and expected to behave in ways that merit that trust. We take advantage of this trust to provide a better learning environment for everyone. In particular, students in cs3102 are expected to follow these rules throughout the course:
I will not lie, cheat or steal. If I am unsure whether something would be considered lying, cheating or stealing, I will ask before doing it.</description>
