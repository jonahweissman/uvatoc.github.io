      <description>A version of this course will be offered in Fall 2020. It is optimistically scheduled for Mondays and Wednesdays, 3:30-4:45 in McLeod Hall 1020 (assuming we will be back to cramming 300 students in a classroom in the fall).
In the happy event that we can offer courses normally in the fall, the content and structure will be fairly similar to what was done in recent semesters. You can see all the materials from recent versions of this course here:</description>

      <description>PDF for PrintingHonor Expectations As a student at the University of Virginia, you are trusted to be honorable and expected to behave in ways that merit that trust. We take advantage of this trust to provide a better learning environment for everyone. In particular, students in cs3102 are expected to follow these rules throughout the course:
I will not lie, cheat or steal. If I am unsure whether something would be considered lying, cheating or stealing, I will ask before doing it.</description>
