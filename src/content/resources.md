suggestions for the book, submit them to Boaz Barak here; useful

## Background Reading

[_Mathematics for Computer Science_ (free
PDF)](https://uvacs2102.github.io/docs/mcs.pdf) by Eric Lehman, F
Thomson Leighton, Albert R Meyer. (This is the book that is sometimes
used in [cs2102: Discrete Math](https://uvacs2102.github.io).) Some
other useful resources for material that is covered in cs2102 are
[here](https://uvacs2102.github.io/resources/).

## Suggestions
