The exam is: [Exam 2](/docs/exam2.pdf)  

Overall, this exam was more difficult than Exam 1 and several of the
problems turned out to be quite challenging (actually, three of them
were impossible!). 

The average scores by problem (as explained on the cover sheet, the
score for a good answer for each problem was 9, other than the Cover
where a "good" answer was worth 6 points) are:
