## Problem Set 4: Countess of Functions

Problem Set 4 is available here: [ps4.pdf](/ps/ps4.pdf) (you will also
need the [ps4.zip](/ps/ps4.zip) file). It is due on **Friday, 18
October** at **4:19pm**.

This assignment involves both PDF and Jupyter parts, and you should
submit both your `ps4.ipynb` and `ps4.pdf` files as attachments in
collab. As far as we know, none of the problems are impossible (we may
be wrong, of course, but none of them are intentionally impossible to
solve).
 
The purpose of this assignment is to continue to develop your
understanding of the asymptotic operators, and to understand deeply
the results in [Chapter 5](/docs/tcs-chapter5.pdf) of the textbook.

**Updated 12 Oct 2019:** The original problem 4b asked you to prove
  something impossible. The question we meant to as is to prove that
  <em>n</em> is in <em>o</em>(<em>n</em> log <em>n</em>). This is
  corrected now, sorry for the confusion and thanks to Gustavo Moreira
  for pointing out the problem.
