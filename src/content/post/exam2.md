Exam 2 will be **Wednesday, 6 November** at the normal class time
in the normal classroom. We will aim to start the exam right at
3:30pm, so you will benefit from arriving early for class Wednesday to
be settled and ready to start the exam.

Exam 2 will cover material from Classes 1-16 (through 28 October) (so
the new material introduced on Rice's Theorem in Class 17 is not
covered in this exam), Problem Sets 1-6 (comments for PS4 and PS5 are
now available in collab, sorry it has taken so long to get the grading
done for these, but you can see our solutions and comments in collab
now; we will post comments for Problem Set 6 on Sunday afternoon), and
the textbook chapters 0-6 and parts of 8 (8.1-8.4). 

_Most_ of the questions on the exam will cover topics that you will
have seen in at least two different places (e.g., both in class and on
a problem set, or in multiple classes, or at least both in the
textbook and in class or a problem set). The exam will emphasize
material that was not covered by Exam 1 (so focusing on the material
on problem sets 4-6), but will also build on material earlier in the
class, and you should be surprised if it does not include induction
proofs.

As a reminder from the syllabus, you may construct a one-page
(letter-size, two-sided) **reference sheet for use during the exam**,
but all other resources are forbidden (no internet, textbook, other
humans, magnification instruments, etc.). We expect that students will
benefit from thinking about what to put on your reference sheet in
preparing for the exam, and you may work with anyone you want
(including other students in the class) to prepare a reference sheets
together.

The class on Monday (November 4) will include an exam review. If you
have specific topics or problems you would like the review to cover,
slack them to `@Dave`.
