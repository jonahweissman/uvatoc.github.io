There was a mistake in PS5, Problem 1, which is now corrected ([updated ps5.pdf](/docs/ps5.pdf), [ps5.zip](/ps5.zip)).

Problem 1a should be:

<tt>
Prove that when $f^*(i) = 0$, $f_{i+1} = f_i$. That is, the two functions denoted by $f_{i + 1}$ and $f_i$ are actually the same function. 
</tt>

Thanks to Joey Rudek for noticing the problem!
