Some of the material from today's class (and what we will continue on
Monday) is in the [TCS Book, Chapter 2](/docs/tcs-chapter2.pdf). Peter
Kahn's [_The Natural Numbers_](/docs/naturalnumbers.pdf) provides a
more complete description of how to build the natural numbers from
sets (and how this leads to the induction principle).

The comic book about Cantor and uncountable infinities is:
[_Logicomix: An epic search for
truth_](https://www.amazon.com/Logicomix-search-truth-Apostolos-Doxiadis/dp/1596914521/)
by Apostolos Doxiadis and Christos Papadimitriou. I don't know any
other comic books about the induction principle, but can (shamelessly) recommend [this comic book on countable infinities](https://dori-mic.org).
