**Update (7 Sept):** There is a correction on slide 10 to the way we defined
  addition for the Set-based Natural Numbers (thanks to Nijat
  Khanbabayev for pointing out the problem).

Some of the material from today's class (and what we will continue on
Monday) is in the [TCS Book, Chapter 2](/docs/tcs-chapter2.pdf). Peter
Kahn's [_The Natural Numbers_](/docs/naturalnumbers.pdf) provides a
more complete description of how to build the natural numbers from
sets (and how this leads to the induction principle).

If you want more practice with induction proofs, or to refresh on what
it means to have a _surjection_ or _bijection_ between two sets, see
[_Mathematics for Computer
Science_](https://uvacs2102.github.io/docs/mcs.pdf) by Eric Lehman,
Tom Leighton, and Albert Meyer (this is what I've been calling the
"MCS" book).

The comic book about Cantor and uncountable infinities is:
[_Logicomix: An epic search for
truth_](https://www.amazon.com/Logicomix-search-truth-Apostolos-Doxiadis/dp/1596914521/)
by Apostolos Doxiadis and Christos Papadimitriou. I don't know any
other comic books about the induction principle, but can (shamelessly) recommend [this comic book on countable infinities](https://dori-mic.org).
