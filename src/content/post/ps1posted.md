## Problem Set 1: (Un)Natural Numbers

Hello students, Problem Set 1 is available here:
[ps1.pdf](/docs/ps1.pdf) (you will also need the
[ps1.zip](/ps/ps1.zip) file described in the PDF). It is due on
**Friday, 13 September** at **4:19pm**.

In this assignment we'll be working with constructive recursive 
definitions (mostly the definition of natural numbers discussed in lecture), 
and proofs by induction.


For this assignment you will be editing the `ps1.tex` (in the 
provided `ps1.zip` file) to produce a new `ps1.pdf` according 
to the instructions in the assignment. Also modify the `ps1.ipynb` 
Jupyter notebook provided according to its instructions within. 

Submit your completed `ps1.ipynb` and `ps1.pdf` as two separate
attachments via collab (you do not need to submit your `ps1.tex` file).

Enjoy!
