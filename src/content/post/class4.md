## Class 4: What Cannot Be Represented by Bits? (Uncountable Sets)

**Schedule Reminders:** [Problem Set 1](/ps1) is due this Friday (4:19pm).  See [the schedule](/schedule) for updated office hours.

Here is Cantor's original proof (in German, but the math is universal, so somewhat understandable even without knowing German):

Georg Cantor, [_Ueber eine elementare Frage der Mannigfaltigkeitslehre_](/docs/cantor-proof.pdf). Published in _Jahresbericht der Deutschen Mathematiker-Vereinigung_, Volume 1, 1891. 

Its only a bit over 2 pages long, and its easy to see Cantor's answer
to the ``Is 0 a Natural Number?'' question without understanding any
German.  Google translates the title as _On an elementary question of
the theory of manifolds_.

Barrow's [_The Infinite
Book_](https://www.amazon.com/Infinite-Book-Boundless-Timeless-Endless/dp/1400032245/)
has chapter on the sad life of Georg Cantor: [_The Madness of Georg
Cantor_](/docs/madness-of-cantor.pdf).

We went through the proof that the binary strings are uncountable
pretty quickly, and this is definitely a mind-blowing result. If you
are not bothered by this result, its probably because you aren't
thinking about things deeply enough. Some other recommended
presentations of these topics include:

- Vi Hart video's on [_Proof some infinities are bigger than other infinities_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA6hE7NFIK0) and [_How many kinds of infinity are there?_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23I5GS4JiDg) (sample youtube comment: <em>watching this makes me feel like i've just taken the red pill and the blue pill, crushed them into a single, purple powder and snorted it</em>).

- Numberphile's, [_Infinity is bigger than you think_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elvOZm0d4H0]).

- You can also see how Prof. Mahmoody and I covered this in [cs2102](https://uvacs2102.github.io) over these three classes (which overlaps a fair bit with what we've done in cs3102, but with more detail and examples): [Class 17: Infinite Sets](https://uvacs2102.github.io/class17/) [[Video](https://uva.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=1b0b99bc-7623-457f-b5d2-73fb64c22c83)], 
[Class 18: Spooky Infinities](https://uvacs2102.github.io/class18/) [[Video](https://uva.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=2aa2b9e6-e148-4239-a4bf-5ad963643514)], [Class 19: Reviewing Infinities](https://uvacs2102.github.io/class19/) [[Video](https://uva.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=8af6f263-4e0b-4cf7-9378-96bdbf7fc8ac)].
