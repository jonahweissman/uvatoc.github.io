Here is Cantor's original proof (in German, but the math is universal, so somewhat understandable even without knowing German):

Georg Cantor, [_Ueber eine elementare Frage der Mannigfaltigkeitslehre](/docs/cantor-proof.pdf). Published in _Jahresbericht der Deutschen Mathematiker-Vereinigung_, Volume 1, 1891. 

Its only a bit over 2 pages long, and its easy to see Cantor's answer
to the ``Is 0 a Natural Number?'' question without understanding any
German.  Google translates the title as _On an elementary question of
the theory of manifolds_.

Barrow's [_The Infinite
Book_](https://www.amazon.com/Infinite-Book-Boundless-Timeless-Endless/dp/1400032245/)
has chapter on the sad life of Georg Cantor: [_The Madness of Georg
Cantor_](/docs/madness-of-cantor.pdf).
