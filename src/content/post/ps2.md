## Problem Set 2: Fine Finite Computation

Problem Set 2 is available here:
[ps2.pdf](/docs/ps2.pdf) (you will also need the
[ps2.zip](/ps/ps2.zip) file described in the PDF). It is due on
**Friday, 20 September** at **4:19pm**.

In this assignment we'll be working with models of finite computation.

This assigned involves only
<em>pencil-and-paper</em> problems (submitted as a PDF by editing the
provided `ps2.tex` template) and there is no programming portion.

Submit your completed `ps2.pdf` as an attachment via collab.
