## Problem Set 0: Getting started

Hello students, Problem Set 0 has been posted to collab. 

The goal of this assignment is to get you acquainted with the tools we
will be using for future assignments this semester: LaTeX (and
overleaf) and Jupyter notebooks (using Python). 

It is due on **Friday, 6 September** at **4:19pm**.

Enjoy!
