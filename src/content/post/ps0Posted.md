## Problem Set 0: Getting Started

Hello students, Problem Set 0 is available here: [ps0.pdf](/docs/ps0.pdf) (you will also need the [ps0.zip](/ps/ps0.zip) file described in the PDF).

The goal of this assignment is to get you acquainted with the tools we
will be using for future assignments this semester: LaTeX (and
overleaf) and Jupyter notebooks (using Python).

It is due on **Friday, 6 September** at **4:19pm**.

Enjoy!
