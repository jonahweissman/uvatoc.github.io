## Problem Set 1: (Un)natural Numbers

Problem Set 1 is available here:
[ps1.pdf](/docs/ps1.pdf) (you will also need the
[ps1.zip](/ps/ps1.zip) file described in the PDF). It is due on
**Friday, 13 September** at **4:19pm**.

In this assignment we'll be working with constructive recursive
definitions (mostly the definition of natural numbers discussed in
lecture), and proofs by induction.

Similarly to [Problem Set 0](/ps0), this assigned involves both
<em>pencil-and-paper</em> problems (submitted as a PDF by editing the
provided `ps1.tex` template) and programming problems (submitted by
modifying the provided Jupyter notebook).

Submit your completed `ps1.ipynb` and `ps1.pdf` as two separate
attachments via collab.
