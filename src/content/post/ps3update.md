There are a few important updates to [Problem Set 3](/ps/ps3.pdf).

- As originally stated, we believe Problem J2 is impossible. We have
  modified the problem to add the constant function _ZERO_ to the gate
  set (which you can represent using `0` in Python. We believe it is
  impossible to solve without this.  We have added an optional (double
  starred!) problem 5 to the PDF part of the assignment which asks you
  to prove that the question as originally asked (and in Exercise 3.6
  in the book) is impossible.

- We added a note to the practice problems: one of these is impossible
  also! In this case, we asked you to prove something that is not
  true. Since these are practice problems, though, and it is good
  practice to be skeptical when you are asked to prove things, we
  haven't changed the actual problem, but will leave it up to you to
  find it and modify it to a correct statement that you can prove.
