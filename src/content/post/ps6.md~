## Problem Set 6: Loopy Tunes

Problem Set 6 is available here: [ps6.pdf](/ps/ps6.pdf) (you will also
need the [ps6.zip](/ps/ps6.zip) file). It is due on **Friday, 1
November** at **4:19pm**.

These is no Jupyter part for PS6, so your submission can be just one `ps6.pdf` file.
 
This assignment covers Turing Machines from [Chapter 6](/docs/tcs-chapter6.pdf), and undecidability (including the halting problem, reductions, and Rice's theorem) from [Chapter 8](/docs/tcs-chapter8.pdf).
