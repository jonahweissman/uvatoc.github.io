The grades for PS1 are now posted. We're really sorry this took so
long! Hopefully we have a process in place now that will be much
faster and more reliable at grading and returning homeworks.

Please look at the posted comments on PS1 in collab: [[PDF](https://collab.its.virginia.edu/access/content/group/ff05ebb2-e2e1-45be-83cb-aadd96d4d2f9/ps1-comments.pdf)] (only accessible to students in the class)

We'll post an update soon with more information about how PS1 was
graded and how to interpret your grade.
