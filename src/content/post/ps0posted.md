## Problem Set 0: Getting Started

Hello students, Problem Set 0 is available here:
[ps0.pdf](/docs/ps0.pdf) (you will also need the
[ps0.zip](/ps/ps0.zip) file described in the PDF). It is due on
**Friday, 6 September** at **4:19pm**.

The goal of this assignment is to get you acquainted with the tools we
will be using for future assignments this semester: LaTeX (and
overleaf) and Jupyter notebooks (using Python).

For this assignment you will be editing the `ps0.tex` and
`missing_file.tex` files (in the provided `ps0.zip` file) to produce a
new `ps0.pdf` according to the instructions in the assignment. Also
modify the `ps0.ipynb` Jupyter notebook provided according to its
instructions within. 

Submit your completed `ps0.ipynb` and `ps0.pdf` as two separate
attachments via collab (you do not need to submit your `ps0.tex` or
`missing_file.tex` files).

Enjoy!
