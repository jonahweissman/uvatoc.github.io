## Problem Set 1 Grades released

We have released problem set 1 grades on collab.

When assigning grades we sought to reward solutions that were high quality, as well as submissions that were overall decent, while not harshly punishing mild mistakes or narrow misconceptions. For this reason we used two metrics to assign your grades: the number of problems on which you received a 5 or higher, and the average of all your problem grades.

 - You earned an A if you got at least 80% 5's or an average of at least 4.5
 - You earned a B if you got a least 70% 5's or an average of at least 4
 - You earned a C if you got a least 60% 5's or an average of at least 3.5
 - You earned a D if you got a least 50% 5's or an average of at least 3.0
 
 The challenge problems counted as a bonus to your count of 5's if you got at least a five, and contributed to the numerator of your average otherwise.
 
 Future problem sets may have use a different procedure for assigning scores to letter grades, depending on our goals for that assignment.
