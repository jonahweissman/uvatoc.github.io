[TCS Chapter 5: Code as data, data as code](/docs/tcs-chapter5.pdf)

The book mostly assumes readers are already familiar with asymptotic
operators, so doesn't include a lot of explanation on this or
exercises. If you feel shaky on it, we recommend reading [Chapter 7:
Cost](https://computingbook.org/Cost.pdf) (from [_Introduction to
Computing Explorations in Language, Logic, and
Machines_](https://computingbook.org/)). (Solutions to the exercises
in that chapter are available on request.)
