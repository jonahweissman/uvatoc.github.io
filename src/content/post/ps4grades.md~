The grades for PS4 are now posted in Assignments on Collab. You will find your grades, comments, and an attached pdf of solutions with PS2 assignment

Our grading policy for PS4 was the same as for PS1, PS2, and PS3, but we reserve the right to change this policy for future assignments. 

To calculate your grade we first computed 2 numbers: 

-   `five_count` = the count of problems for which you earned a 5 or above
-   `sum` = the sum of the scores earned on all problems
-   `non_star_count` = the number of non-starred problems in the assignent
-   `score_by_fives = five_count / non_star_count`
-   `score_by_average = sum / non_star_count`

That policy was:

 - You earned an A if `score_by_fives >= 0.80` or `score_by_average >= 4.5`
 - You earned a B if `score_by_fives >= 0.70` or `score_by_average >= 4.0`
 - You earned a C if `score_by_fives >= 0.60` or `score_by_average >= 3.5`
 - You earned a D if `score_by_fives >= 0.50` or `score_by_average >= 3.0`
 
Bonusses were added when we felt it appropriate.
 
 If you did not receive a grade for the assignment, this is mostly likely because you submitted late, and we could find no record of us giving you permission to do so.
