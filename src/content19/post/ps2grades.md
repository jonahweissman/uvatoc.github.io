The grades for PS2 are now posted in Assignments on Collab. You will find your grades, comments, and an attached pdf of solutions with PS2 assignment

Our grading policy for PS2 was the same as for PS1, but we reserve the right to change this policy for future assignments. That policy was:

 - You earned an A if you got at least 80% 5's or an average of at least 4.5
 - You earned a B if you got a least 70% 5's or an average of at least 4
 - You earned a C if you got a least 60% 5's or an average of at least 3.5
 - You earned a D if you got a least 50% 5's or an average of at least 3.0
 
 The challenge problems counted as a bonus to your count of 5's if you got at least a five, and contributed score/5 to the numerator of your average otherwise (i.e., as a bonus).
 
 If you did not receive a grade for the assignment, this is mostly likely because you submitted late, and we could find no record of us giving you permission to do so.
