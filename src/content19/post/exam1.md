Exam 1 will be next **Wednesday, 2 October** at the normal class time
in the normal classroom. We will aim to start the exam right at
3:30pm, so you will benefit from arriving early for class Wednesday to
be settled and ready to start the exam.

Exam 1 will cover material from Classes
1-<strike>9</strike> <b>8</b> (through
<strike>25</strike> <b>23</b> September) [Note: we have revised
the coverage scope to not include any new material from Class 9 on
Exam 1], Problem Sets 1-3 (including the comments we provide on them;
we will post comments for Problem Set 3 shortly after it is due on
September 30), and the textbook chapters 0-4. _Most_ of the questions
on the exam will cover topics that you will have seen in at least two
different places (e.g., both in class and on a problem set, or in
multiple classes, or at least both in the textbook and in class or a
problem set).

As a reminder from the syllabus, you may construct a one-page
(letter-size, two-sided) **reference sheet for use during the exam**,
but all other resources are forbidden (no internet, textbook, other
humans, magnification instruments, etc.). We expect that students will
benefit from thinking about what to put on your reference sheet in
preparing for the exam, and you may work with anyone you want
(including other students in the class) to prepare a reference sheets
together.

The class on Monday (September 30) will be an exam review. If you have
specific topics or problems you would like the review to cover, slack
them to `@Dave`.
