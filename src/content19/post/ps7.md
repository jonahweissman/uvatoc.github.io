## Problem Set 7: Is <b>P</b> a proper subset of <b>NP</b>?

Problem Set 7 is available here: [ps7.pdf](/ps/ps7.pdf) (you will also
need the [ps7.zip](/ps/ps7.zip) file). It is due on **Tuesday, 26
November** at **7:29pm**.

Note that PS7 is considerably longer than previous problem sets, and
you have a longer time period to complete it. I covers a lot of
challenging material from recent (and upcoming) classes and book
chapters 11-14.
