**Oral Exam Requests.** Out of 157 students who filled in something we
could interpret as a grade for the Oral Exam Request on the last page,
there were 40 who filled in the exact grade they received in the
course, 109 who filled in a lower grade than they received (of whom 50
received at least a full letter grade higher than the minimum grade
entered), and 8 who filled in a higher grade than the grade we
determined was appropriate (and have the opportunity to improve their
grade by doing an oral exam).

We realize that this was not quite a "tell us the grade you think you
deserve" question since some people may find having to do an oral exam
a non-neutral experience, but we these results do give us some
confidence that most students will consider their course grade fair.

**Office Hours Tuesday.** If you would like to retrieve your exam, or have anything else you'd
like to discuss, we will have our normal office hours on Tuesday
(Dave, 9-11am in Rice 507; Nathan, 4-6pm in Rice 209).
