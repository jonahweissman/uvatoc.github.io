To be in this class, students are expected to agree to the [Course
Pledge](/pledge). The expectations there apply to everything connected
with this class including all assignments, classes, and office hours.

Before **2:59pm this Wednesday** (Sept 4) you must read and agree to
the contents of the Course Pledge, and submit [this
assignment](https://collab.its.virginia.edu/portal/site/ff05ebb2-e2e1-45be-83cb-aadd96d4d2f9/tool/00120935-6be7-4122-b1c1-36a4649ec981)
(in collab) to acknowledge having done this. (It is not necessary to print and submit the pledge on paper or as a scanned PDF.)

If you have any questions about it or disagree with any of the
expectations in it, send a message to `@dave @Nathan Brunelle` in the
course slack (or discuss with one of us some other way).
