There were several mistakes in PS5, Problem 1, which are now corrected ([updated ps5.pdf](/ps/ps5.pdf), [ps5.zip](/ps/ps5.zip)).

**Problem 1a** should be:

<tt>
Prove that when $f^*(i) = 0$, $f_{i+1} = f_i$. That is, the two functions denoted by $f_{i + 1}$ and $f_i$ are actually the same function. 
</tt>

Thanks to Joey Rudek for noticing the problem!

**Problems 6 and 7** mixed up NAND-CIRC and NAND-TM. Problem 6 should be
asking if NAND-LOOP is more powerful than NAND-CIRC (it would be silly
to ask if it is more powerful than NAND-TM, since NAND-TM has
everything in NAND-LOOP plus arrays, so there's no way NAND-LOOP could
be more powerful than NAND-TM). Similarly, Problem 7 should be asking
if NAND-ARRAY is more powerful than NAND-CIRC.

Thanks to Jiahe for pointing out the problems!

Sorry for all the confusing mistakes on this problem set.
