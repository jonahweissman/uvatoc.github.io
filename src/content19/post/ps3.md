## Problem Set 3: Sugary Finite Computation

Problem Set 3 is available here: [ps3.pdf](/ps/ps3.pdf) (you will also
need the [ps3.zip](/ps/ps3.zip) file described in the PDF). It is due
on **Monday, 30 September** at **2:59pm**. (Note the unusual due date
and time. The schedule is unusual because of Exam 1, which will be
held Wednesday, 2 October, in class.)


The purpose of this assignment is to continue to develop your
understanding of finite computation, focusing on the material in
Chapter 4 of the textbook and what we cover in Class 7 and Class 8 and
Class 9.  This assignment is also meant to prepare you for Exam 1,
which will be held in class on Wednesday, 2 October (a separate post
will provide more details on Exam 1). In addition to the graded
problems, we have provided some additional problems to help you
prepare for Exam 1. You do not need to turn anything in for these
problems, but we expect that most students will benefit from doing
them to be prepared to do well on the exam.

This assignment involves both PDF and Jupyter parts, and you should
submit both your `ps3.ipynb` and `ps3.pdf` files as attachments in
collab.

**Note (Sept 24)**: see [Problem Set 3 Update](/ps3update/)
