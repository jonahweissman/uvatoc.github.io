      <description>The grades for PS2 are now posted in Assignments on Collab. You will find your grades, comments, and an attached pdf of solutions with PS2 assignment
Our grading policy for PS2 was the same as for PS1, but we reserve the right to change this policy for future assignments. That policy was:
 You earned an A if you got at least 80% 5&amp;rsquo;s or an average of at least 4.</description>

      <description>Exam 1 will be next Wednesday, 2 October at the normal class time in the normal classroom. We will aim to start the exam right at 3:30pm, so you will benefit from arriving early for class Wednesday to be settled and ready to start the exam.
Exam 1 will cover material from Classes 1-9 (through 25 September), Problem Sets 1-3 (including the comments we provide on them; we will post comments for Problem Set 3 shortly after it is due on September 30), and the textbook chapters 0-4.</description>

      <description>There are a few important updates to Problem Set 3.
 As originally stated, we believe Problem J2 is impossible. We have modified the problem to add the constant function ZERO to the gate set (which you can represent using 0 in Python. We believe it is impossible to solve without this. We have added an optional (double starred!) problem 5 to the PDF part of the assignment which asks you to prove that the question as originally asked (and in Exercise 3.</description>

      <description>The grades for PS1 are now posted. We&amp;rsquo;re really sorry this took so long! Hopefully we have a process in place now that will be much faster and more reliable at grading and returning homeworks.
Please look at the posted comments on PS1 in collab: PDF
When assigning grades we sought to reward individual solutions that were high quality and total submissions that were overall decent, while not harshly punishing mild mistakes or narrow misconceptions.</description>

      <description>Problem Set 3: Sugary Finite Computation Problem Set 3 is available here: ps3.pdf (you will also need the ps3.zip file described in the PDF). It is due on Monday, 30 September at 2:59pm. (Note the unusual due date and time. The schedule is unusual because of Exam 1, which will be held Wednesday, 2 October, in class.)
The purpose of this assignment is to continue to develop your understanding of finite computation, focusing on the material in Chapter 4 of the textbook and what we cover in Class 7 and Class 8 and Class 9.</description>

We take advantage of this trust to provide a better learning environment for everyone. In particular, students in cs3102 are expected to follow these rules throughout the course:
I will not lie, cheat or steal. If I am unsure whether something would be considered lying, cheating or stealing, I will ask before doing it.</description>
