Alan M. Turing, On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem. 1936. (bug fix) (You missed your chance to by an original printing for GBP 30,000.)
According to Scott Aaronson, Dori-Mic and the Universal Machine! A Tragicomic Tale of Combinatorics and Computability for Curious Children of All Ages is &amp;ldquo;The BEST babies&amp;rsquo; book about computational universality I&amp;rsquo;ve read.&amp;rdquo;.

      <description>Two more updates to PS5:
 Problem 7 considered adding an array but not loops to NAND-CIRC. But, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to have arrays without any way to update the index used to access them. So, for this to make sense we need to also have an instruction to update i. So, we have modified this question to add conditional increment and decrement instructions:
 CINC v takes a regular variable as its input, and if the value of v is 1 it updates the value of i to be i + 1.</description>

      <description>There were several mistakes in PS5, Problem 1, which are now corrected (updated ps5.pdf, ps5.zip).
Problem 1a should be:
 Prove that when $f^*(i) = 0$, $f_{i+1} = fi$. That is, the two functions denoted by $f{i + 1}$ and $f_i$ are actually the same function. 
Thanks to Joey Rudek for noticing the problem!
Problems 6 and 7 mixed up NAND-CIRC and NAND-TM. Problem 6 should be asking if NAND-LOOP is more powerful than NAND-CIRC (it would be silly to ask if it is more powerful than NAND-TM, since NAND-TM has everything in NAND-LOOP plus arrays, so there&amp;rsquo;s no way NAND-LOOP could be more powerful than NAND-TM).</description>

TCS Chapter 5: Code as data, data as code
The book assumes readers are already familiar with asymptotic operators, so doesn&amp;rsquo;t include a lot of explanation on this or exercises. You probably have also encountered these in other classes, but without a formal definition of their meaning (and possibly misused in confusing ways).</description>

Exam 1 will cover material from Classes 1-9 8 (through 25 23 September) [Note: we have revised the coverage scope to not include any new material from Class 9 on Exam 1], Problem Sets 1-3 (including the comments we provide on them; we will post comments for Problem Set 3 shortly after it is due on September 30), and the textbook chapters 0-4.</description>

      <description>There are a few important updates to Problem Set 3.
 As originally stated, we believe Problem J2 is impossible. We have modified the problem to add the constant function ZERO to the gate set (which you can represent using 0 in Python. We believe it is impossible to solve without this. We have added an optional (double starred!) problem 5 to the PDF part of the assignment which asks you to prove that the question as originally asked (and in Exercise 3.</description>

      <description>PDF for Printing Honor Expectations As a student at the University of Virginia, you are trusted to be honorable and expected to behave in ways that merit that trust. We take advantage of this trust to provide a better learning environment for everyone. In particular, students in cs3102 are expected to follow these rules throughout the course:
I will not lie, cheat or steal. If I am unsure whether something would be considered lying, cheating or stealing, I will ask before doing it.</description>
