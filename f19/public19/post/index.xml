Dear Theory of Computation Students,
Thank you for registering for cs3102!
Weâ€™re looking forward to the fall semester, as much as one can under these circumstances, and considering plans for the course.</description>

      <description>A version of this course will be offered in Fall 2020. It is optimistically scheduled for Mondays and Wednesdays, 3:30-4:45 in McLeod Hall 1020 (assuming we will be back to cramming 300 students in a classroom in the fall).
In the happy event that we can offer courses normally in the fall, the content and structure will be fairly similar to what was done in Fall 2019, and you can see all the materials from that course on this website.</description>

Oral Exam Requests. Out of 157 students who filled in something we could interpret as a grade for the Oral Exam Request on the last page, there were 40 who filled in the exact grade they received in the course, 109 who filled in a lower grade than they received (of whom 50 received at least a full letter grade higher than the minimum grade entered), and 8 who filled in a higher grade than the grade we determined was appropriate (and have the opportunity to improve their grade by doing an oral exam).</description>

      <description>Exam 3 will be Wednesday, 4 December at the normal class time in the normal classroom. We will aim to start the exam right at 3:30pm, so you will benefit from arriving early for class Wednesday to be settled and ready to start the exam. This is the final exam for the class and we will not use the registrar-scheduled final exam time, but recall from the course syllabus that there will still be an opportunity for students who feel they were &amp;ldquo;not be able to demonstrate their best ability during a 75 minute in-class exam, &amp;hellip; to request an oral final exam to be scheduled with one of the instructors during the exam period.</description>

      <description>Problem Set 7: Is P a proper subset of NP? Problem Set 7 is available here: ps7.pdf (you will also need the ps7.zip file). It is due on Tuesday, 26 November at 7:29pm.
Note that PS7 is considerably longer than previous problem sets, and you have a longer time period to complete it. I covers a lot of challenging material from recent (and upcoming) classes and book chapters 11-14.</description>

The exam is: Exam 2
Overall, this exam was more difficult than Exam 1 and several of the problems turned out to be quite challenging (actually, three of them were impossible!).
The average scores by problem (as explained on the cover sheet, the score for a good answer for each problem was 9, other than the Cover where a &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; answer was worth 6 points) are:</description>

      <description>The grades for PS4 are now posted in Assignments on Collab. You will find your grades, comments, and an attached pdf of solutions with PS2 assignment
Our grading policy for PS4 was the same as for PS1, PS2, and PS3, but we reserve the right to change this policy for future assignments.
To calculate your grade we first computed the following:
 five_count = the count of problems for which you earned a 5 or above sum = the sum of the scores earned on all problems non_star_count = the number of non-starred problems in the assignent score_by_fives = five_count / non_star_count score_by_average = sum / non_star_count  That policy was:</description>

Exam 2 will cover material from Classes 1-16 (through 28 October) (so the new material introduced on Rice&amp;rsquo;s Theorem in Class 17 is not covered in this exam), Problem Sets 1-6 (comments for PS4 and PS5 are now available in collab, sorry it has taken so long to get the grading done for these, but you can see our solutions and comments in collab now; we will post comments for Problem Set 6 on Sunday afternoon), and the textbook chapters 0-6 and parts of 8 (8.</description>

      <description>Two more updates to PS5:
  Problem 7 considered adding an array but not loops to NAND-CIRC. But, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to have arrays without any way to update the index used to access them. So, for this to make sense we need to also have an instruction to update i. So, we have modified this question to add conditional increment and decrement instructions:
  CINC v takes a regular variable as its input, and if the value of v is 1 it updates the value of i to be i + 1.</description>

      <description>There were several mistakes in PS5, Problem 1, which are now corrected (updated ps5.pdf, ps5.zip).
Problem 1a should be:
 Prove that when $f^*(i) = 0$, $f_{i+1} = f_i$. That is, the two functions denoted by $f_{i + 1}$ and $f_i$ are actually the same function.  Thanks to Joey Rudek for noticing the problem!
Problems 6 and 7 mixed up NAND-CIRC and NAND-TM. Problem 6 should be asking if NAND-LOOP is more powerful than NAND-CIRC (it would be silly to ask if it is more powerful than NAND-TM, since NAND-TM has everything in NAND-LOOP plus arrays, so there&amp;rsquo;s no way NAND-LOOP could be more powerful than NAND-TM).</description>

TCS Chapter 5: Code as data, data as code
The book assumes readers are already familiar with asymptotic operators, so doesn&amp;rsquo;t include a lot of explanation on this or exercises. You probably have also encountered these in other classes, but without a formal definition of their meaning (and possibly misused in confusing ways).</description>

      <description>The grades for PS2 are now posted in Assignments on Collab. You will find your grades, comments, and an attached pdf of solutions with PS2 assignment
Our grading policy for PS2 was the same as for PS1, but we reserve the right to change this policy for future assignments. That policy was:
 You earned an A if you got at least 80% 5&amp;rsquo;s or an average of at least 4.</description>

      <description>Exam 1 will be next Wednesday, 2 October at the normal class time in the normal classroom. We will aim to start the exam right at 3:30pm, so you will benefit from arriving early for class Wednesday to be settled and ready to start the exam.
Exam 1 will cover material from Classes 1-9 8 (through 25 23 September) [Note: we have revised the coverage scope to not include any new material from Class 9 on Exam 1], Problem Sets 1-3 (including the comments we provide on them; we will post comments for Problem Set 3 shortly after it is due on September 30), and the textbook chapters 0-4.</description>

      <description>There are a few important updates to Problem Set 3.
  As originally stated, we believe Problem J2 is impossible. We have modified the problem to add the constant function ZERO to the gate set (which you can represent using 0 in Python. We believe it is impossible to solve without this. We have added an optional (double starred!) problem 5 to the PDF part of the assignment which asks you to prove that the question as originally asked (and in Exercise 3.</description>

      <description>The grades for PS1 are now posted. We&amp;rsquo;re really sorry this took so long! Hopefully we have a process in place now that will be much faster and more reliable at grading and returning homeworks.
Please look at the posted comments on PS1 in collab: [PDF] (only accessible to students in the class)
When assigning grades we sought to reward individual solutions that were high quality and total submissions that were overall decent, while not harshly punishing mild mistakes or narrow misconceptions.</description>

      <description>Problem Set 3: Sugary Finite Computation Problem Set 3 is available here: ps3.pdf (you will also need the ps3.zip file described in the PDF). It is due on Monday, 30 September at 2:59pm. (Note the unusual due date and time. The schedule is unusual because of Exam 1, which will be held Wednesday, 2 October, in class.)
The purpose of this assignment is to continue to develop your understanding of finite computation, focusing on the material in Chapter 4 of the textbook and what we cover in Class 7 and Class 8 and Class 9.</description>
